	Q. What are Data Structures?
	sol'n:- Data Structures is the arrangement of the data in the mmeory in the way so that the program can use 
	that data efficienty to perform operations like addition, deletin, updation etc.
	
	Q. What are Java Collection Frameworks?
	sol'n:- Collection Frameworks in java is the palce where all the implementation of different data STructures
	is already coded and is just ready to use. We can use that data Structures like list, set, map, hash, Queue etc.
	
	
	*******Java Collection Framework*****
	0. Collection Interfaces
	1. List
	2. Set 
	3. Queue
	4. Map
	5. Natural Ordering and Sorting
	6. Comparators
	
	----Explanation----
	
	0. Collection Interface:- Collection interface is the root interface of the collection framwork heirarchy
	and everything below are the subInterfaces of the collection framwork.
	
	 Java does not provide direct implementation of the collection interfaces but provides the implementation
	 of it's subinterfaces like set, queue, list, map etc.
	 
	 
	 *******Methods of Implementation********
	 
	 1. add() - inserts the specified element to the collection
	 2. remove() - removes the specified element from the collection.
	 3. size() - returns the size of the collection.
	 4. iterator() - returns an iterator to access the elements of the collection.
	 5. addAll() - adds all the elements of the specified collection to the collection.
	 6. removeAll() - removes all the elements of the specified collectionm to the collection.
	 7. clear() - removes all the elements of the collection.
	 
	 
	 Note:- We can also create our own data Structure in the collection and it will use all the method of the 
	 implementation descirbed above.
	 
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	 
	 1. List Interface:- In Java the list interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and access
	 elements sequenctally. It extends the collection interface.
	 
	 Since the List is an interface we cannot create objects from it. In order to use the functions of the list 
	 interface, we can use these Classes.
	 1. ArrayList
	 2. LinkedLlist
	 3. Vector 
	 4. Stack
	 
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	 2. Set Interface:- the Set interface of the java collection framework provides the features of the mathematical
	 set in java. It extends the collection interface. Unlike the list interface, sets cannot contain duplicate 
	 elements.
	 
	 In order to use the functionlities of the set interface we can use these classes:
	 1. HashSet
	 2. LinkedHashSet
	 3. EnumSet
	 4. TreeSet
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	 
	 3. Queue Interface: The Queue interface of the java collection framework provides the functionality of the
	 queue data STructures. It extends the collectin interface.
	 
	 In order to use the functionalities we need to use the classes to implement it.
	 1. ArrayDeque
	 2. LinkedList
	 3. PriorityQueue
	 
	 
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	 
	 4. Map Interface: The Map interface of the java Java collection Framework provide the functionality of the 
	 map Data Strucrues.
	 
	 Since map is an interface we cannot create objects from it.
	 
	 In order to use the functin... we have to use these classe:
	 1. HashMap
	 2. EnumMap
	 3. LinkedHashMap
	 4. WeakHashMap
	 5. TreeMap
