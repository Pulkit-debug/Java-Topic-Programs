	/*
	Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations
	and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part(More precisely to be called refference part).
	The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as node. Due to the dynamicity and ease
	of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays.ArraysIntro
	
	It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from the
	head and follow through the line to reach to a node we wish to access.
	
	// ********** Linked List in Java *************
	 
	 To store the elements in a linked list we use a doubly linked list which provides a linear data structure and also used to
	 inherit an abstract class and implement list and deque interfaces. In Java. LinkedList class impolements the list interface.
	 
	 The LinkedList class also consists of various constructors and methods like other java collections.
